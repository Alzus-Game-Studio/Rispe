## Prologue

> A long time ago, all the land of Papora lived in sadness, envy, greed, hatred, and chaos. It was deplorable, as if God had abandoned them. But everything changed when an ancient king, a hero named Viatas, unified the world and sealed all evil in exchange of his freedom. 
> 
> Not only his body, but his soul was also corrupted.
> 
> Trapped in a purple crown, Viatas will be protected with respect by all future kings of Papora. This crown, despite maintaining the soul of the hero, is full of all the evils of the world and is capable of causing great temptation and different phenomena in its bearers. 
> 
> So the kings must be strong, so as not to let the evil of the crown be released on the world. Unfortunately this legend of peace was interrupted.
> 
> When the kingdom of Papora lived its greatest boom of harmony and peace, an epidemic affected the kingdom. The current queen acquired a degenerative disease that is getting worse and Rispe, the current crown bearer, embarks on a journey through the 7 great kingdom for saving his wife. Unfortunately, Rispe's entire journey will be a deception of the crown, so that little by little it seizes him and destroys all of Papora. Rispe wants to save his wife, but Viatas wants to destroy the world.
